  <!-- About Section -->
  <section>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Muazzaz Ahmed Choudhury, also known as Faaiz Choudhury, is presently pursuing his B.A. LL.B. with earnest dedication. Hailing from the culturally rich town of Karimganj, Assam, he carries within him a deep-rooted sense of purpose and determination to grow through knowledge, expression, and service.</p>
    <p>His academic journey is shaped by a passion for law, eloquence, and intellectual clarity. He engages in thoughtful pursuits that refine his reasoning and strengthen his voice, whether through writing, legal studies, or artistic expression. Faaiz believes in lifelong learning that connects wisdom with justice and in pursuing excellence where thought meets purpose.</p>
    <p>He belongs to a family with a distinguished legacy that spans from Mesopotamia to Mughal India. His ancestor, Muhammad Karim Baksh, a prince from Mesopotamia, came to Delhi in 1599 AD during Emperor Akbar's reign to become a disciple of the revered Sufi saint Hazrat Baqi Billah (R.A.). His son, Nawab Jan Muhammad Khan Bahadur, was appointed Faujdar of Bihar in 1663 (Sanad No. T997/319) and later as the Faujdar of Mughal Bengal's Sylhet Sarkar in 1666 AD under Emperor Aurangzeb. From this lineage emerged Dewan Arman Ali Choudhury, the zamindar of Ujandihi, Karimganj.</p>
    <p>During the Partition of 1947, while 111 out of 112 Choudhury families of Ujandihi migrated to East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), his great-grandfather Dr. Rosman Ali Choudhury, a British-era physician and freedom fighter, chose to remain in India, anchored in the belief in democracy, secularism, and national integrity. His legacy of service, scholarship, and resilience continues to inspire Faaiz's aspirations.</p>
    <p>Whether through the written word, legal advocacy, or creative expression, Faaiz strives to honour that legacy by contributing meaningfully to his generation's discourse — rooted in clarity, culture, and conviction.</p>
